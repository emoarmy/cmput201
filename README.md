# cmput201

This is a repository of all the code written in my CMPUT 201 class, in the C language.

It includes a term long project, broken into 3 parts. The goal for this project was to write an algorithm to take in a set of X and Y coordinate and generate a rectilinear steiner tree.
This required:
- Read input from the command line or from a file
- Validate data being read from a file
- Generate random data and display it in the command line or a file.
- Create a minimum spanning tree for the set of coordinates
- Create an alogrithm to determine a [reactilinear steiner tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectilinear_Steiner_tree)
